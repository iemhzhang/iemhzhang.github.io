The model includes the use of expert knowledge to set variables, build models, train models, and test the four main steps, and use this to predict the return water temperature after time t after the model is built. The results show that on the basis of the original 11 related variables, the addition of 3 expert variables makes the four models have higher correlation coefficients for predicting the return water temperature. The measured parameters can more accurately predict the return water temperature of the chiller at this time, the mean square error reaches 0.1069, and the R square reaches 0.9923, and this information is used to feedback and adjust the system to solve the delay caused by the reservoir.

First of all, this thesis deploys the two-class fault recognition and multi-class fault recognition of variable refrigerant flow systems based on three commonly used deep transfer learning algorithms. They are the migration adaptive enhancement algorithm (TrAdaBoost) , the deep neural network transfer learning algorithm (DNN-TL) and Joint Distributed Adaptation Algorithm (JDA). Then the key parameters of the deep transfer learning model are optimized. Finally, the model is analyzed from evaluation indicators such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and hit rate, and it is combined with the supervised algorithm model, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural network. (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for comparison. The results show that, on the one hand, when compared with the traditional supervised learning algorithm model, TrAdaBoost is 46%-51% more accurate than XGBoost. Compared with DNN, DNN-TL increases by 1%-4%. On the other hand, when three different methods of deep transfer learning algorithms compare the results of binary classification and multi-class fault recognition, TrAdaBoost is 2%-9% higher than DNN-TL, and TrAdaBoost is 38%-55% higher than JDA. The overall effect of TrAdaBoost model is slightly better than that of DNN-TL, which indicates that the deep transfer learning model has stronger generalization ability, and has a better diagnostic effect on data tasks with different distributions. Finally, as the size of the training data increases, the accuracy of DNN-TL is about 8% higher than that of DNN. For all training data sizes, especially in the small training data for electronic expansion valve fault identification, the accuracy of TrAdaBoost's model is significantly higher. For DNN-TL, this proves the advantage of TrAdaBoost for transfer learning on small training data.\n","tags":[],"title":"Research on Electronic Expansion Valve and Compressor Liquid Floodback Fault Diagnosis Based on Deep Transfer Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622989114,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622989114,"objectID":"cf4c5132e8ca2ee140a9803706551f4c","permalink":"/-publication/research-on-electronic-expansion-valve-and-compressor-liquid-floodback-fault-diagnosis-based-on-deep-transfer-learning/","publishdate":"2021-06-06T22:18:34+08:00","relpermalink":"/-publication/research-on-electronic-expansion-valve-and-compressor-liquid-floodback-fault-diagnosis-based-on-deep-transfer-learning/","section":" publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Research on Electronic Expansion Valve and Compressor Liquid Floodback Fault Diagnosis Based on Deep Transfer Learning","type":" publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622863742,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622863742,"objectID":"545789ba425e31a257f3b02ba257dbc7","permalink":"/energy-consumption-prediction-of-rf-wanda-realm-hotel-in-state-grid-based-on-deep-learning-algorithm/","publishdate":"2021-06-05T11:29:02+08:00","relpermalink":"/energy-consumption-prediction-of-rf-wanda-realm-hotel-in-state-grid-based-on-deep-learning-algorithm/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Energy Consumption Prediction of R\u0026F Wanda Realm Hotel in State Grid Based on Deep Learning Algorithm","type":"page"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I am an optimistic and cheerful person, I like to make friends with different people, I like to experience projects and games that I have not played before, and keep my enthusiasm and curiosity about life.

However, one serious issue has been raised in recent studies, which shows that training classifiers with datasets which suffer of imbalanced class distributions can significantly influence the final classification accuracy. So, aiming at the imbalanced dataset environment problem of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system based on data-driven fault detect and diagnosis, we conducted a study. First of all, through comparative research, it is concluded that the geometric mean accuracy of the fault detection in the VRF system has reduced an average of 42.49% due to the imbalanced data environment. Then we proposed a Principal Component Analysis-Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (PCA-SMOTE) method to save this problem, and verified the reliability and versatility of the proposed method with three types of modeling algorithms commonly used in VRF systems. The result shows that this method not only has obvious improvement effect, but also has strong versatility. In the end, we gradually reduce the number of minority from 50 to 10 to explore minimum fault data requirements of this method. The final result shows that this method can still ensure that common machine learning algorithms can effectively detect and diagnosis the VRF system fault when only 10 fault data are included.\"\n","tags":[],"title":"Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis For Residential Variable Refrigerant Flow System On Imbalanced Data Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhang Menghua","Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The energy efficiency of VRF systems in different climate demarcation are evaluated and analyzed. The results show that cooling (heating) load, power consumption, average values of COP(coefficient of performance) and PLR(part load ratio) of VRF systems vary significantly in different climate regions. In hot summer and warm winter areas, the PLR and COP are greater than those in cold areas and in hot summer and cold winter areas. From cold regions to hot summer and warm winter regions, the cooling load and cooling power consumption of the system increase, while the heating load and heating power consumption decrease. The annual average COP difference between cold regions and hot summer and cold winter regions is 0.27, while the difference between hot summer and cold winter regions and hot summer and warm winter regions is 0.59.
