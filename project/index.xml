      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;&#34;&gt;
•	This project uses a combination of simulation and experiment to study the airflow field of the cold storage, mainly studying the airflow field between the fruit box and the fruit box after the fruit box is placed in the cold storage.
•	This project establishes a three-dimensional physical model, uses Ansys Icem CFD software for structural meshing, uses Fluent software for solving calculations, and uses Tecplot software for post-processing, and finally obtains the simulation content.
•	The simulation of this project mainly studies the distribution of the airflow field between the fruit bins when the apples are pre-cooled. The boundary conditions in the simulation are measured experimentally.
