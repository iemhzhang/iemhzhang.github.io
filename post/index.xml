      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an optimistic and cheerful person, I like to make friends with different people, I like to experience projects and games that I have not played before, and keep my enthusiasm and curiosity about life. As Pushkin said, &amp;ldquo;If life deceives you, donâ€™t be sad, everything will pass, and what has passed will become cordial nostalgia.&amp;rdquo;
Now, as a student and researcher, I work in the School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. As an engineer, I need to treat our projects with a rigorous attitude. Therefore, I need to invest more time in the laboratory. Therefore, I often adhere to the rhythm of life from coming to work very early to going back to rest very late.
In addition to being a researcher, I am also a member of the Red Cross. I will often play with mentally handicapped children so that they can experience more fun; I will also go to the stray cat and dog base to be a responsible &amp;ldquo;shovel&amp;rdquo;. Shiguan&amp;quot;; I also participated in various first aid training, and held first aid training activities, popular science first aid knowledge, helping others is my pleasure, because &amp;ldquo;giving someone a rose, the hand has a lingering fragrance.&amp;rdquo;
To be an ideal scientific researcher is my pursuit. Of course, life also needs adjustment. Outside of research, I am an outgoing person and it is easy to get along with others. I have various hobbies, such as running, cycling, Tai Chi, fitness, jazz, singing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
